Running App Study

Author and Stakeholder: Tim Wang
Date: 5/10/2017

Background:
I am a fan of jogging as a way to lose weight and as a stress reliever. However, there are days that I know I should go jogging but just have no motivation. I want to use this study to first find out if other runners/atheletic people use an app to keept track of their run, and second, find out what keeps them motivated. And if there is anyway I use an app to keep them motivated on those days when we all feel really lazy.

Goals:
To find out what kind of running apps people use and if those apps affect their motivation.

Research Questions:
1. How often do you exercise
2. Do you have your phone with you when you exercise
3. Do you use an app to monitor your exercise activity
4. Have you ever skipped an exercise because you were feeling unmotivated

Methodology:
I will be conducting personal interviews as well as sending a form with my questions to friends and family

Participants:
I will be asking people who are either very atheletic and those who sometimes exercise. Because I want my app to motivate those on the fence of exercising to start exercising.

Schedule:
Interview will start on 5/10 and continue until 5/12
